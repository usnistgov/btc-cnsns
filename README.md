# Overview

The purpose of this code and data is to enable reproduction
and facilitate extension of the computational
results associated with Ref. [1].


# Installation

The library dependencies can be installed with [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
using the [Dockerfile](.devcontainer/Dockerfile).
One option is to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
and open the folder with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
Then re-open the folder in a container using the configuration
file provided.

# Reproducing the Manuscript

The calculations leading to [Fig. S1](out/figureS1.png) and [Fig. S2](out/figureS2.png)
are reproduced via

```bash
bash calc_figureS1.sh && bash calc_figureS2.sh
```

These figures can then be plotted via

```bash
python3 plot_figureS1.py && python3 plot_figureS2.py
```

The saved figures can be found in ```out/figureS1.png``` and ```out/figureS2.png```.

The data leading to [Fig. 3](out/figure3.png), [Fig. 4](out/figure4.png),
and [Fig. S3](out/figureS3.png) can be produced by

```bash
bash calc_figure3_figure4_figureS3.sh
```
These figures can be generated by
```bash
python3 plot_figure3_figureS3.py && python3 plot_figure4.py
```
and their output found in the ```out/``` folder as before.

Finally, Figure 4 can be reproduced via

```bash
bash calc_figure4.sh
```

# Documentation

The documentation can be compiled using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/),

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

The documentation generated can be viewed by then opening
[index.html](./doc/html/index.html) in a browser.
